This week's data is about (New York) MTA Permanent Art Catalog.

Further information and detailed specification can be found on the official [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-07-22) repo.


#### Context: 
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has an initiative called Arts & Design that installs permanent artworks in subway stations and transit hubs across New York. These pieces range from glass mosaics and stainless steel sculptures to ceramic murals, created by hundreds of artists since the 1980s.


#### The dataset contains 2 csv files: 
      - mta_art.csv
      - station_lines.csv

The second file 'station_lines.csv' maps stations to their lines and is a more granular version of the data in the 'mta_art' table which contains of multiple lines as a single record against a station. The exploration done in this project is using the first file 'mta_art' only.
