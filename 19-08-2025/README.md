## Week 19th Aug 2025 - Scottish Munros Data

This week's data is about Scottish Munros, which are Scottish mountains with an elevation of over 3,000 feet. A 'Munro' is named after Sir Hugh Munro, who produced the first list of these hills in 1891.
The data comes from  Database of British and Irish Hills v18.2, [link] (https://www.hills-database.co.uk/). 
Thank you to Nicola Rennie, for curating this dataset.
Further information and detailed specification can be found on the official [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-08-19) repo.


#### The dataset contains 1 csv file: 
      - scottish_munros.csv

##### Notes:
- A Munro Top is a subsidiary summit of a Munro that also exceeds 3,000 feet in height but is not considered a distinct mountain in its own right.
- Munros lack a rigid set of criteria for inclusion, and so, re-surveying can lead to changes in which peaks are included on the list.
