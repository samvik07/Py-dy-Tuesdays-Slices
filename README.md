# Py-dy-Tuesdays-Slices
Bite-sized weekly data explorations in Python, in connection with #TidyTuesday. One dataset, one slice at a time!

This repo contains weekly data exploration and visualisation challenges inspired by the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project — using Python. 

"PydyTuesday is a Posit collaboration with TidyTuesday for exploring TidyTuesday data in Python."


### 📦 Dataset Sources
Original datasets and descriptions can be found at the official [TidyTuesday GitHub repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).


### 🔍 How It Works
Each week, a new dataset is shared in the TidyTuesday repo (link mentioned above). The idea is to spend about 30 minutes exploring the data — answering a question, visualising patterns, or finding a small insight.

Most of the work here is done in 30–60 minutes, but there's always room to return later for deeper analysis or polish.
