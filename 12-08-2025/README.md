## Week 12th Aug 2025 - Extreme Weather Attribution Studies

This week's data is about weather attribution research data, which studies whether climate change has made specific extreme events more likely or severe.
The data comes from  Carbon Brief's article [Mapped: How climate change affects extreme weather around the world](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/attribution-studies/index.html). 
Dataset curated by Rajo.
Further information and detailed specification can be found on the official [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-08-12) repo.


#### The dataset contains 2 csv files: 
      - attribution_studies.csv
      - attribution_studies_raw.csv

As suggestive from the names of the csv files, the 'attribution_studies' file is a cleaner version of the raw file, primarily focussing on the time period of the event - whether it was an event that occurred in a single year or a trend that spans across multiple years.
The exploration done in this project is using the 'attribution_studies.csv' file only.

- The regions denoted by 'cb_region' column in the dataset, are based on the geographic region classification used by Carbon Brief (Based on UN classification).
