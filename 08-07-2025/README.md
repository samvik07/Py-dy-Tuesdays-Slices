This week's data is about the 2010 [xkcd Color survey](https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/), in which hundreds of thousands of people were asked to name colors they saw, revealing the different ways in which people perceive and label colors. 
Further information and detailed specification can be found on the official [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-07-08) repo.


#### The dataset contains 3 csv files: 
      - answers.csv
      - color_ranks.csv
      - users.csv

Note: The answers.csv table is a subset of the full answers data where the color_name_answer was one of the names of the 5 top ranked colors in the color_ranks data.
