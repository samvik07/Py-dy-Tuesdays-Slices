## Week 02nd Sep 2025 - Australian Frog Diversity Data by their Call Records
This week's data is about frog call records in Australia, which are recorded through FrogID mobile app by citizen scientists and then sent to experts for identification.
The data comes from  the sixth annual release of [FrogID data](https://www.frogid.net.au/explore).
  
  Thanks to Jessica Moore for curating this dataset.
Further information and detailed specification can be found on the official [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-09-02) repo.


#### The dataset contains 2 csv files: 
      - frogID_data.csv
      - frog_names.csv


##### Some Interesting Points:
- FrogID is an Australian frog call identification initiative. Since 2017, FrogID data has contributed to over 30 scientific papers exploring frog ecology, taxonomy, and conservation.
- Australia is home to a unique and diverse array of frog species found almost nowhere else on Earth, with 257 native species distributed throughout the continent.
- Australia's seasons are at opposite times to those in the Northern Hemisphere. Dec-Feb is Summer, Mar-May is Autumn, Jun-Aug is Winter, and Sep-Nov is Spring.
