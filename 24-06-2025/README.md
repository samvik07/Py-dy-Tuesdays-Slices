## Week 24th June 2025 - Measles Cases

This week's data is about measles and rubella cases across the world, from the original data source being the World Health Organisation Provisional monthly measles and rubella data on 2025-06-12. 
Further information and detailed specification can be found on the official [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-06-24/readme.md) repo.


#### The dataset contains 2 CSV files:
              - cases_month.csv
              - cases_year.csv


##### Some of the conventions used in the dataset:
              - Data spans 6 WHO regions:
                    • "AFRO" : African Region (Sub-Saharan Africa)
                    • "AMRO" : Region of the Americas (North, Central & South America)
                    • "EMRO" : Eastern Mediterranean Region (Middle East, North Africa, parts of South Asia)
                    • "EURO" : European Region (Europe and parts of Central Asia)
                    • "SEARO": South-East Asia Region (India, Indonesia, Thailand, etc.)
                    • "WPRO" : Western Pacific Region (China, Australia, Japan, Philippines, etc.)
              
              - There are 3 types of case classifications:
                    • ✅ Lab-confirmed : Verified through lab testing
                    • 🔗 Epi-linked    : Epidemiologically connected to a confirmed case
                    • 👁️ Clinical      : Based on symptoms (no lab or epidemiological link)

##### While the dataset had many layers to explore, I focussed to answer:
          📊 How have measles cases changed globally over time?
          🌐 Do case classifications reveal healthcare surveillance capacities across regions?


This dataset has a wealth of information and required understanding several specific terms, which made it challenging to interpret it within 30 minutes. 
So this week’s task took a fair bit more time than usual!
